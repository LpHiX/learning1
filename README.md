Hello and welcome to this project!

This is a colloboration between Lphix and md5sha256 to create a minecraft plugin. 
The project is currently in a very alpha stage and is expected to be used as a core plugin in the ganagamlorder server. The plugin will be ported to 1.14 soon.

There are no guarentees this will work and compiling must be taken with caution.
